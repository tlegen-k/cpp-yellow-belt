# Tasks from week 1 of course

## C++ Yellow belt

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from week 1 of [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-yellow/home/welcome)

### Regions base

Consider that block sizes are measured in centimeters, density in grams per cubic centimeter, and total weight in grams. Thus, the mass of the block can be calculated as a simple product of density and volume.
Input format

The first line contains two positive integers: the number of blocks N and the density of each block R. Each of the next N lines contains three positive integers W, H, D - the sizes of the next block.

It is guaranteed that:

+ the number of blocks N does not exceed 10 ^ 5;
+ block density R does not exceed 100;
+ the sizes of blocks W, H, D do not exceed 10 ^ 4.
