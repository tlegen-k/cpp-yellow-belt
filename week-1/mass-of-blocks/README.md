## Mass of blocks

Calculate the total mass of cuboid-shaped blocks of the same density but different sizes.
Indication

Consider block sizes in centimeters, density in grams per cubic centimeter, and total weight in grams. Thus, the mass of a block can be calculated as a simple product of density and volume.

### Input format.

The first line contains two positive integers: the number of blocks N and the density of each block R. Each of the next N lines contains three positive integers W, H, D - the sizes of the next block.

It is guaranteed that:

    the number of blocks N does not exceed 10 ^ 5;
    the block density R does not exceed 100;
    block sizes W, H, D do not exceed 10 ^ 4.
