### Solve the “Average Temperature” problem in other restrictions on the input data.

The temperature values observed for N consecutive days are given. Find the numbers of days (in numbering from scratch) with a temperature value above the arithmetic average of all N days.

It is guaranteed that the arithmetic mean of the temperature is an integer.
Input format

Enter the number N, then N integers - the temperature on the 0th, 1st, ... (N − 1) day. It is guaranteed that N does not exceed one million (10 ^ 6), and temperature values measured in millionths of degrees Celsius range from −10 ^ 8 to 10 ^ 8. It is not necessary to verify compliance with these restrictions: you can focus on them when choosing the most suitable types for variables.
Output format

The first number K is the number of days in which the temperature is higher than the arithmetic average. Then K integers are the numbers of these days.
