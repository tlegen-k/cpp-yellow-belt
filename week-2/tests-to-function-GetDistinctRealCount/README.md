## Tests for function GetDistinctRealRootCount
Function
``` cpp
{
    int GetDistinctRealRootCount(double a, double b, double c);
}
```
returns the number of unique real roots of the equation axÂ² + bx + c = 0. Develop a set of unit tests to verify that this function is implemented correctly. The case when all three coefficients are equal to zero does not need to be tested.

You can get started with a template that contains our unit test framework and the GetDistinctRealRootCount function template.
