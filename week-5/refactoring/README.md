## Code refactoring
In this assignment, you will change the code to match the principles outlined in the course.

Imagine that you inherited this code from a colleague and now you have to maintain and improve it. The first thing you decide to do is refactor.

The ultimate goals of the refactoring are:

- simplify further code support;
- reduce the complexity of the code;
- make it easier to add new abstractions to the program.

The assignment will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- efficiency of code execution;
- duplicated code;
- the effectiveness of using the code refactoring techniques shown in the lectures.

In addition, the code you submit must compile.
