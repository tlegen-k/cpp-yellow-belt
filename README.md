# Welcome to repository

## C++ Yellow belt

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-yellow/home/welcome)
 
## Course description
This course is a continuation of the C ++ Development Fundamentals: White Belt course. In it, teachers continue to acquaint you with the capabilities of the C ++ language. The course examined:
- C ++ integer types
- couples and tuples
- function templates
- inheritance and polymorphism
- iterators and standard algorithms
- distribution of code across multiple files

In addition, the course discusses the use of unit tests for debugging programs and ensuring code reliability, and also demonstrates how, using the knowledge of only the White and Yellow belts, to develop your own unit test framework.

Just like in the White Belt, at the end of the course you will find the final project. In the "White Belt" it was necessary to independently implement a simple data warehouse with the ability to add, delete and search. In the Yellow Belt, this repository will need to be improved by adding support for more complex queries.
BTW, course is taught in russian.
