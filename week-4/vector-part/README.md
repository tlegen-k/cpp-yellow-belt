## Vector part
Write a PrintVectorPart function that takes a vector of integers numbers, searches for the first negative number in it, and prints all the numbers to the left of the found number to standard output in reverse order. If the vector does not contain negative numbers, print all the numbers in reverse order.
```Cpp
void PrintVectorPart(const vector<int>& numbers);
```
