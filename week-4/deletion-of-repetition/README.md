## Deletion of repetitions
Write a template function RemoveDuplicates that takes a vector elements of objects of type T by reference and removes all duplicate elements from it. The order of the remaining elements can be any.

It is guaranteed that objects of type T can be compared using the operators ==,! =, <And>.
```cpp
template <typename T>
void RemoveDuplicates(vector<T>& elements);
```
